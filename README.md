# Project Title

Build your own Resume on VueJS - Version 1.0.0

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This project on its first version gets its data from a [Real Time Database on Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database/). 
If you wish to setup your own data, you will have to:
 - Create a real time database with your account.
 - Set the read/write permits as:
```
"rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": false
  }
```
 - Edit this template with your data and upload it to the database by importing as .json file.
```

To start the application run:

## Deployment

To host this application you will need some server or service that serve your files. 
In my personal Resume, Im ussing Innmotion Hosting, with a custom domain. But feel free to use whatever you want. 
For easy and quick launch you might want to use [S3 Amazon Buckets](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and configure it like in this [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/static-website-hosting.html).

In order to build your production app run:
```
npm run build
```
You will find a new 'dist' folder on your project folder. Inside of it you will find your app prepared to be upload as a website.
Upload the content to your hosting.
